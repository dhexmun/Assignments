## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- HTML Table
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

**Note: The latter of the above was only an attempt.**

### What I Learned

For a start, I learnt how to create a good Flexbox and Grid Layout. While in addition to that, I got to play around some CSS custom properties and tried to successfully understand it's inner workings. Some code samples of areas I did fancy in task week4 and would like to highlight is seen below:

```css
.grid-container {
   display: grid;
   grid-template-areas: 
      "a a a a b b"
      "a a a a b b"
      "c c c d d d"
      "c c c e e e"
   ;
   grid-gap: 10px;
}
```
Also learnt to an extent some proper ways of writing a complete and presentable README file in task week5 like this one you're reading. And task week3 in itself was nothing short of intriguing as I had to try out things I never taught I could do especially while building my portfolio-website such as this:

```html
   <footer id="newsletter">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Subscribe to our Newsletter</h2>
        <form>
          <input type="email" placeholder="Enter Email..." required>
          <button type="submit" class="button_1">Subscribe</button>
        </form>
      </div>
      
      <h4>.... breathing life into your imaginations<span> ‚Ä¢|‚Ä¢ </span>Copyright &copy;2022</h4>
   </footer>
```

### Continued Development

Like I stated earlier, there's alot still to be learnt, something I'm glad looking forward to. During the course of these challenges, I came to an understanding that there are other ways/method one could adopt for the layouts especially when doing something enormous and I intend to explore, refine and perfect all there is to be amongst the best in the webspace.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgJSmiOUi_E) - In this video, CSS variables,  specificity and the likes was buttressed, a well explanatory tutorial I don't think I could have done without.
- [Example of Flexbox Layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUBnyr-9tug&list=PLxuUHF3OiqfWVlH5BTGUA9OboRF13Zyaj&index=12&t=16s) - This ZuriTeam video recording on introduction to flexbox layout helped me a mile, the methods adopted seem quiet explanatory enough for me.
- [Example of Grid Layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly8rHvRQBy0&t=170s) - This is another nice video which helped me finally understand the basics of Grid Layout, a method I ended up adopting. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
