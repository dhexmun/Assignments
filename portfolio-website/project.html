          <p>
            With the help of resources at our disposal, we've been able to come up with quiet a few interesting projects in so little a time with some still in the works, citing most recently an application that takes account of passengers commuting a train station on a daily which we chose to call <i>"Passenger Counter App"</i>. Some others like it too which people have found interesting, an interactive online <i>"BlackJack Game"</i> built to engage a class of audience. <i>A "Quiz App"</i> nonetheless, with a timer built to test how knowldegeable one is in the field of web development and so on.<br>
            We go on to list in no particular order some of our previously executed projects:
